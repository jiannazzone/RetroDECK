#### Prerequisites Dolphin: Hardware

In addition to the controllers:

- You need to have a bluetooth dongle or built-in bluetooth adapter.

#### How to configure Dolphin: 3rd Party Wii Remote


##### Make a Bluetooth Passthrough udev rule

**ðŸ›‘ Warning ðŸ›‘**<br>
This method will make the bluetooth adapter unusable for other devices while playing Wii Games and not other devices can connect to it except Wiimotes. <br>

If you need other devices connected, it is recommended to buy a separate bluetooth dongle that works on Linux and use that.

**How to:**

REWRITE

A udev rule has to be installed so Dolphin can use a Bluetooth adapter without having to get root privileges.

1. Paste the following into `/etc/udev/rules.d/52-dolphin.rules`. Replace `YOURVID` and `YOURPID` with the `Vendor ID` and `Product ID` respectively.

`SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="YOURVID", ATTRS{idProduct}=="YOURPID", TAG+="uaccess`

2. Reload udev rules with: `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`

3. Reinsert the adapter.

Dolphin should be able to automatically unload the USB Bluetooth kernel module (assuming you have permission to; you typically need to be in the plugdev group). If not, unload it with `modprobe -r btusb`.


##### Enable Bluetooth Passthrough in Dolphin

Open `RetroDECK Configurator` -> `Open Emulator` -> `Dolphin` -> `Options` -> `Controller Settings`

Change to `Passthrough a Bluetooth Adapter`

Press the `Sync Button` on the Wiimote and press the `Sync Button` in the Dolphin Interface.<br>
It should now be connected and be enabled to be used with the Wii games.
