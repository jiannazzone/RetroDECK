## Nintendo Motion Controllers


### Wii Remote (Wiimote) & Nunchuck

<img src="../../wiki_images/controllers/wii-mote.png" width="250"><img src="../../wiki_images/controllers/wii-nunchuck.png" width="250">

The main input for the Nintendo Wii.

#### TIP: Dolphin Sync Wiimote Hotkey

RetorDECK has a built-in hotkey for pressing the Dolphis `Sync Wiimote` button `Alt + W` if you find yourself dissconnected.<br>
It can also be accessed from some controllers radial menu systems on for example the Steam Deck.

#### Prerequisites Dolphin: Hardware

In addition to the controllers:

- You need to have a bluetooth dongle or built-in bluetooth adapter. For the second method you might need two depending on your usecase.
- You will need to have a Wii Sensor Bar or an 3rd party alternative.

#### Steam Deck Tips:

- As of now it is easier to configure Wiimotes in desktop mode then transfer over to game mode when everything is working (We will make easier tools later in the Configurator).
- The recommended method of playing is docked connected to a monitor and you could have a seperate blueooth dongle attached to the dock for method 2.
- It could be helpful to have a Keyboard / Mouse connected to the dock while setting everything up.
- It is good to sit close to the Steam Deck when paring

#### How-to configure Dolphin - Method 1: Bluetooth Connection

This only works with the Official Wiimote conntroller and is the easier method.

#### How-to configure Dolphin - Method 2: Bluetooth Passthrough

This works with both 3rd party Wiimotes and Official and is a harder method.

**ðŸ›‘ Warning ðŸ›‘**<br>

- This method will make the bluetooth adapter unusable for other devices while playing Wii Games and not other devices can connect to it except Wiimotes.

- If you need other devices connected, it is recommended to buy a separate bluetooth dongle that works on Linux and use that.

**Step 1: Find your ID's**

First you need to find our your `Vendor ID` `Product ID` for the bluetooth adapter you want to use.

1. Open a terminal window
2. Type `lsusb`
3. It will now display all connected USB or BUS devices that you have connected. Example:

```
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:5650 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 8087:0025 Intel Corp. Wireless-AC 9260 Bluetooth Adapter
```

`ID 8087:0025 Intel Corp. Wireless-AC 9260 Bluetooth Adapter` is the Bluetooth Adapter in this example.

The `ID 8087:0025` left value is the `Vendor ID` while the right is `Product ID`.<br>
Thus in this example: `Vendor ID` is `8087`:`Product ID` is `0025`.

---

**Step 2: Create the rules file.**

You will need root privlages for this.

Type type the following command and replace `Vendor ID` and `Product ID` respectively.:

`sudo echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="Vendor ID", ATTRS{idProduct}=="Product ID", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/52-dolphin.rules > /dev/null`

from the example above the result should look like this:

`sudo echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="8087", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0025", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/52-dolphin.rules > /dev/null`

2. Reload udev rules with: `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`
3. Take out and reinsert the bluetooth adapter or reboot if a built-in was used.

**Step 3: Enable Bluetooth Passthrough in Dolphin**

<img src="../../wiki_images/emulators/dolphin/dolphin-bluetooth-pass.png" width="450">

Open `RetroDECK Configurator` -> `Open Emulator` -> `Dolphin` -> `Options` -> `Controller Settings`


Change bluetooth type:

- From `Emulate the Wii's bluetooth adapter` to `Passthrough a Bluetooth Adapter`

Enable the following checkboxes:

- `Connect Wii Remotes for Emulated Controllers`
- `Continous Scanning`

---

**Step 4: Syncing the Wiimotes**

The Wiimote can now be connected when a game is launched, but it will not connect before that.
It will need to reconnect every time when launching a new game.

You will need to `Sync Wiimote` the Wiimote by pressing  `1` and `2` together on the Wiimote or the `Sync Button` (under the backplate), when launching a game.

Sometimes you will also need to press the `Sync Button` on the Emulated Wii in the Dolphin Interface, this can be found in the controller menu in Dolphin or RetroDECK has a built in shortcut for this `Alt + W` that is also be accessed from the RetroDECK Radial Menu system on the Steam Deck while in Game Mode under Dolphin.

---

**Extra: Troubleshooting and tips**

- Always sit close to the device when you are doing the initial paring.
- Sometimes it can take a while before the paring happens, specially on 3rd party Wiimotes. You might need to try multiple times with both the `Sync Button` + `Sync Wiimote`.
- If you want to play with normal controllers as Wiimotes again the best way is to change back to: `Emulate the Wii's bluetooth adapter` setting.
- If the udev rules you created in Step 2 are wrong and Dolphin can not get bluetooth access: It will display a error message and crash. If that happens go back and make sure that the file in `/etc/udev/rules.d/52-dolphin.rules` and the content is correct.
