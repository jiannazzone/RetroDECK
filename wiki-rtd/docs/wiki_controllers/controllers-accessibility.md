# Accessibility Controllers

Accessibility Controllers is a small category of specialized controllers that are designed to primarily to meet the needs of gamers with limited mobility.

They can be customized to fit the players needs with swapable inputs from various sources controlled by the main hub of the a adaptive controller.

You can also sometimes expand to more inputs as well by connecting other controller types like a Flight Stick, external joysticks or buttons.

### The xone Project
[The xone Project](https://github.com/medusalix/xone) <br>
Has firmwares, udev rules and drivers might be needed to get it to run on your distribution to get the wireless connections working.

### How to configure?
The Linux Kernel has had XAC support since version 3.17.<br>
As the XAC outputs standard xinput we don't see any reason why this should not work with RetroDECK.

None on the RetroDECK Team owns a XAC, but we would love to hear from your experiences using it with RetroDECK. <br>

If there is something we in the team can help you with, maybe we can design a better general Steam Input profile for the XAC or any other feedback feel free to contact us on Discord.
