#### Installing the Toypad

This controller needs to set a system's udev rule, just execute this in the terminal:
```bash
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0e6f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0241", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/71-toypad.rules > /dev/null
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

#### What emulator support the Toypad?
At the moment of writing the best way to play LEGO Dimensions with the LEGO Toypad is to use the PS3 version and the RPCS3 emulator.
Just connect the ToyPad to a USB port before starting the game.

**Special Notes on the Steam Deck**

The ToyPad must be connected to an powered USB-hub such as the a USB port of the Steam Dock. <br>
Directly connecting the ToyPad to the Steam Deck it's not working as the Steam Deck can not give the ToyPad enought power output.
