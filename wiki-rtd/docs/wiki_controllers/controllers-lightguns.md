The GUN4IR uses LED point strips around your display and allows you to rebuild existing lightguns or toyguns into the GUN4IR system. <br>

- A configuration software with a valid license is required that be bought from the website (or come with a GUN4IR total system purchase)
- The software is as of this date Windows only, you will need to connect the Windows device to the display you want to use.
    - The calibration and firmware updates can be done in Windows on the display you want to play on.
    - After the calibrtion you can unplug the device and use it in Linux (but not RetroDECK yet).
