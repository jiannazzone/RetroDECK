# A RetroDECK Doomy December:

Twas the night before Christmas, and all through Mars space.<br>
Not a creature was stirring, all over the base. <br>
The chainsaws were hung by the fireplace with care. <br>
In hopes that the demons would soon be there.

# GZDoom and modding

We in the RetroDECK team always believe that modding is a core part of the retro gaming experience.

Even if you install GZDoom today from flathub it can be quite daunting for the average player on how to get it running.
Access the hidden folders and understand what configs to edit to make it work.

So what we are working on now is to make it at least a bit easier to play DOOM mods with RetroDECK.

## How it works today

The files you put in /retrodeck/roms/doom/ today are:

- .iwad
- .wad
- .pwad
- .pk3
- .ipk3
- .pk4

They are run by default with the RetroArch core PrBoom.

## How it will work in 0.8b

With the addition of GZDoom
