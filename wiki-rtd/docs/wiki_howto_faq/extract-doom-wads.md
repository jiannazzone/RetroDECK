### How to extract them?

Each file is located in the `WADs/` folder from the step above with an ID number that you can check on the list.

#### Example: Sigil

Sigil has the ID of `4` and is then located in the `/WADs/4/` folder.

Within that folder there are images and also a file without an extension just called `4`.
That `4` file is the `SIGIL.WAD` file.

All you need to do is copy the ``/WADs/4/4` file to `retrodeck/roms/doom` then rename it `SIGIL.WAD`.


## Extra: Windows tips

If you want to move the WADs from a Windows installations instead you can use this software:
[Unity Doom Ripper](https://github.com/kevansevans/Unity-Doom-Ripper)

The WADs are located in

`My Documents\Saved Games\id Software\DOOM 2\WADs\`

or

`My Documents\Saved Games\id Software\DOOM Classic\WADs\`

Then just transfer them with a USB Stick or another way to your Linux machine.

## Where can I find more WADs?

None-official wads (mods) are all over the internet from old forums, github and various websites.
